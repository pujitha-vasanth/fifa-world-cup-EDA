# FIFA World Cup
The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship is contested every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. It is one of the most prestigious and important trophies in the sport of football.

# Objective
